# Hermione - AI chess engine
Side project for fun. Hermione is an AI chess engine I'm building from scratch.

Goal is to get it so good that it can beat me at a rapid chess game (10 min + 0 sec). I'm rated ~1900 rapid on Lichess.

Todo:
- [x] Find a simple C/C++ library with chess rules. I'm using [THC Chess Library](https://github.com/billforsternz/thc-chess-library), it's literally a 2 file import.
- [ ] Download chess GUI app and implement [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface). Basically, UCI is how chess engines talk to GUI.
- [ ] Implement basic alpha/beta pruning
- [ ] Build a neural net from scratch and have it play something
- [ ] Train the neural net
- [ ] Evaluate its performance, if it can beat me, project is finished
