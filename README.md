# Hermione - AI chess engine
Side project for fun. Hermione is an AI chess engine I'm building from scratch.

Goal is to get it so good that it can beat me at a rapid chess game (10 min + 0 sec). I'm rated ~1900 rapid on Lichess.

Todo:
- [ ] Connect third party chess board
- [ ] Implement basic alpha/beta pruning
- [ ] Build a neural net from scratch and have it play something
- [ ] Train the neural net
- [ ] Evaluate its performance, if it can beat me, project is finished
